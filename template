ABOUT_ME
Hi! I am, as pretentious as this may sound, an innately curious individual whose goals are to to just *DO MORE AND DO NEW THINGS*.

I am interested in everything, but currently learning things with some semblance of *far-transfer* (ie experimenting with my [qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia), learning math, physics, control theory, go, biology, neuroscience, "machine learning", and more, and doing random chaotic things for fun!)

I strongly dislike self help books, and I like hanging out with other people who question and enjoy life. My internal monologue is a mix of verbal, visual, and conceptual.

# Books
- [An Infinitely Large Napkin](https://venhance.github.io/napkin/Napkin.pdf). Free, detailed overview of [basically all](https://web.evanchen.cc/upload/recent-flowchart.png) of the fun math, with engaging problemsets and very clear explanations. I am not done with this yet but I love how much knowledge it distills if you read and truly engage with it. One of my favorite books ever.
